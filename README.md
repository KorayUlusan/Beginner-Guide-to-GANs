- **Presentation**: Slides used during my seminar presentation.

## Seminar Information
- **Course Title**: Proseminar: Topics in Deep Neural Networks
- **Semester**: WS 23/24
- **Instructors**: Valentin Bolz, Marcel Hallgarten
- **Language**: English
- **Credits**: 3 LP
- **Max Participants**: 12

## Description
Deep learning is a fast-evolving subfield of machine learning that has achieved state-of-the-art results in various AI applications, including computer vision and robotics. The seminar covered fundamental topics such as:
- Famous neural network datasets and architectures
- Commonly used training strategies
- Popular programming frameworks
- Applications in object recognition, image classification, regression, etc.

Students were evaluated based on:
1. Their **presentation** on a selected topic.
2. A **written report** summarizing their research.
3. **Active participation** in discussions.

My written report, **"Synthetic Image Generation,"** explores the influential role of image generation in today's world and its impact on daily life. The paper explains the **generator-discriminator structure of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)**, along with their **training algorithm** and the **problems they pose**, in a way that is understandable to someone new to the field. It also delves into the **capabilities of GANs and CycleGAN** to provide a deeper understanding of the subject and relate them to contemporary models. Furthermore, the report presents **various GAN architectures** and connects core concepts to other aspects of machine learning to offer a comprehensive overview of the topic.

**Keywords**: **GANs**, **Image Generation**, **CycleGAN**.

The paper covers the following main areas:
- **Introduction** to image generation and the significance of GANs.
- An overview of **earlier approaches** in image generation, including **Deep Belief Networks (DBNs)** and **Variational AutoEncoders (VAEs)**. The concept of **latent vectors** is also introduced.
- A detailed explanation of **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)**, including their **value function** and **training algorithm**. It also discusses **initial findings** and the concept of **Nash equilibrium**.
- Examination of **training problems** associated with GANs, such as **mode collapse** and **vanishing gradients**.
- Exploration of the **capabilities of GANs**, including tasks like **image super-resolution**, **image denoising**, **image inpainting**, **image fusion**, **image captioning**, **text-to-image translation**, and **domain adaptation**, with a specific mention of **CycleGAN** for unpaired image-to-image translation.
- A brief overview of **modern methods** in image generation, highlighting the rise of **diffusion models** and other state-of-the-art models like **CM3Leon** and **MUSE**.
- A **conclusion** summarizing the importance of GANs and their relationship to newer methods.

## Requirements
- No formal prerequisites, but a strong background in **linear algebra** and **statistics** is beneficial.
- Attendance was required for successful completion.
